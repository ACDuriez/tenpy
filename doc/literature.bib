  abstract = {Matrix product purifications (MPPs) are a very efficient tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures. When a system features symmetries, these can be used to reduce computation costs substantially. It is straightforward to compute an MPP of a grand-canonical ensemble, also when symmetries are exploited. This paper provides and demonstrates methods for the efficient computation of MPPs of canonical ensembles under utilization of symmetries. Furthermore, we present a scheme for the evaluation of global quantum number distributions using matrix product density operators (MPDOs). We provide exact matrix product representations for canonical infinite-temperature states, and discuss how they can be constructed alternatively by applying matrix product operators to vacuum-type states or by using entangler Hamiltonians. A demonstration of the techniques for Heisenberg spin-1/2 chains explains why the difference in the energy densities of canonical and grand-canonical ensembles decays as 1/L.},

  abstract = {Lie-Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are an efficient way to approximate operator exponentials \$\textbackslash exp(t H)\$ when \$H\$ is a sum of \$n\$ (non-commuting) terms which, individually, can be exponentiated easily. They are employed in time-evolution algorithms for tensor network states, digital quantum simulation protocols, path integral methods like quantum Monte Carlo, and splitting methods for symplectic integrators in classical Hamiltonian systems. We provide optimized decompositions up to order \$t\^6\$. The leading error term is expanded in nested commutators (Hall bases) and we minimize the 1-norm of the coefficients. For \$n=2\$ terms, several of the optima we find are close to those in McLachlan, SlAM J. Sci. Comput. 16, 151 (1995). Generally, our results substantially improve over unoptimized decompositions by Forest, Ruth, Yoshida, and Suzuki. We explain why these decompositions are sufficient to efficiently simulate any one- or two-dimensional lattice model with finite-range interactions. This follows by solving a partitioning problem for the interaction graph.},

  abstract = {Given a microscopic lattice Hamiltonian for a topologically ordered phase, we describe a tensor network approach to characterize its emergent anyon model and, in a chiral phase, also its gapless edge theory. First, a tensor network representation of a complete, orthonormal set of ground states on a cylinder of infinite length and finite width is obtained through numerical optimization. Each of these ground states is argued to have a different anyonic flux threading through the cylinder. In a chiral phase, the entanglement spectrum of each ground state is seen to reveal a different sector of the corresponding gapless edge theory. A quasi-orthogonal basis on the torus is then produced by chopping off and reconnecting the tensor network representation on the cylinder. Elaborating on the recent proposal of [Y. Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. B 85, 235151 (2012)], a rotation on the torus yields an alternative basis of ground states and, through the computation of overlaps between bases, the modular matrices S and U (containing the mutual and self statistics of the different anyon species) are extracted. As an application, we study the hard-core boson Haldane model by using the two-dimensional density matrix renormalization group. A thorough characterization of the universal properties of this lattice model, both in the bulk and at the edge, unambiguously shows that its ground space realizes the \textbackslash nu=1/2 bosonic Laughlin state.},

In contrast to numerical methods restricted to small finite sizes, the infinite cylinder geometry allows us to access and characterize directly the metal to fractional Chern insulator transition. We find indications it is first order and no evidence of other competing phases. Since our approach does not rely on any band or subspace projection, we are able to prove the stability of the fractional state in the presence of interactions exceeding the band gap, as has been suggested in the literature.

We discuss how the resulting algorithm resembles the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finding ground states so closely that it can be implemented by changing just a few lines of code and it inherits the same stability and efficiency. In particular, our method is compatible with any Hamiltonian for which DMRG can be implemented efficiently and DMRG is obtained as a special case of imaginary time evolution with infinite time step.},

We introduce an MPS based method that allows to find the minimally entangled representation by iteratively minimizing the second Renyi entropy.

Specifically, we explore a variety of integrable and non-integrable, gapless and gapped models at temperatures ranging from T=infty down to T/bandwidth=0.05 and study both (i) linear response where (heat and charge) transport coefficients are determined by the current-current correlation function and (ii) non-equilibrium driven by arbitrary large temperature gradients.

The resulting algorithm has a surprisingly close relationship to Vidal's Time Evolving Block Decimation for infinite systems, but allows much faster convergence. Access to a translationally invariant matrix product state allows the calculation of correlation functions based on the transfer matrix, which directly gives the spectrum of all correlation lengths.

Each symmetric tensor decomposes into two types of tensors: degeneracy tensors, containing all the degrees of freedom, and structural tensors, which only depend on the symmetry group. In numerical calculations, the use of symmetric tensors ensures the preservation of the symmetry, allows selection of a specific symmetry sector, and significantly reduces computational costs. On the other hand, the resulting tensor network can be interpreted as a superposition of exponentially many spin networks. Spin networks are used extensively in loop quantum gravity, where they represent states of quantum geometry.

  abstract = {We discuss a method based on sampling minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) that can simulate finite temperature quantum systems with a computational cost comparable to ground state DMRG. Detailed implementations of each step of the method are presented, along with efficient algorithms for working with matrix product states and matrix product operators. We furthermore explore how properties of METTS can reveal characteristic order and excitations of systems and discuss why METTS form an efficient basis for sampling. Finally, we explore the extent to which the average entanglement of a METTS ensemble is minimal.},

  abstract = {The Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method scales exponentially in the system width for models in two dimensions, but remains one of the most powerful methods for studying 2D systems with a sign problem. Reviewing past applications of DMRG in 2D demonstrates its success in treating a wide variety of problems, although it remains underutilized in this setting. We present techniques for performing cutting edge 2D DMRG studies including methods for ensuring convergence, extrapolating finite-size data and extracting gaps and excited states. Finally, we compare the current performance of a recently developed tensor network method to 2D DMRG.},

In addition, in many cases where ordinary DMRG can get stuck in metastable configurations, the correction eliminates the sticking. We test the new method on the Heisenberg S=1 chain.},

  abstract = {We report the theoretical discovery of a systematic scheme to produce topological flat bands (TFBs) with arbitrary Chern numbers. We find that generically a multi-orbital high Chern number TFB model can be constructed by considering multi-layer Chern number C=1 TFB models with enhanced translational symmetry. A series of models are presented as examples, including a two-band model on a triangular lattice with a Chern number C=3 and an \$N\$-band square lattice model with \$C=N\$ for an arbitrary integer \$N\$. In all these models, the flatness ratio for the TFBs is larger than 30 and increases with increasing Chern number. In the presence of appropriate inter-particle interactions, these models are likely to lead to the formation of novel Abelian and Non-Abelian fractional Chern insulators. As a simple example, we test the C=2 model with hardcore bosons at 1/3 filling and an intriguing fractional quantum Hall state is observed.},

  abstract = {We introduce a numerical algorithm to simulate the time evolution of a matrix product state under a long-ranged Hamiltonian. In the effectively one-dimensional representation of a system by matrix product states, long-ranged interactions are necessary to simulate not just many physical interactions but also higher-dimensional problems with short-ranged interactions. Since our method overcomes the restriction to short-ranged Hamiltonians of most existing methods, it proves particularly useful for studying the dynamics of both power-law interacting one-dimensional systems, such as Coulombic and dipolar systems, and quasi two-dimensional systems, such as strips or cylinders. First, we benchmark the method by verifying a long-standing theoretical prediction for the dynamical correlation functions of the Haldane-Shastry model. Second, we simulate the time evolution of an expanding cloud of particles in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, a subject of several recent experiments.},
